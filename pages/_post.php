	<h1>"Nice" summer walk</h1>
	<p>That year I got new bicycle and go for long trip across the country. I made my way to our capital, but because of bad weather I could not return back.<br>They told me that it should be Ok soon. So I begun my way back nd suddenly new bike broke.<br>15km., broken bike, rain! I was ready for that. I had a raincoat.<br>In about 3hrs. I was slepping at home. Really exhausted but! HAPPY)
