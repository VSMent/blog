It‚Äôs a massively important space that I constantly get asked about so I decided it was time to put this article out.\r\n\r\nI have been preaching the power of podcasts and voice technology for the last 18-24 months. Podcasts and audio-first consumption are clearly exploding, and they‚Äôre one of the best ways to get started creating content for your business, product, service or brand. I recently wrote an article on ‚ÄúThe Rise of Audio and Voice‚Äù that you can read to understand my $.02\r\n\r\nAs multitasking culture continues to grow, podcasts take on a more important role in our everyday life. We all care about our time and if there‚Äôs a way to save some, we‚Äôll do it. Just like music or audiobooks, podcasts can be consumed while doing laundry, going to the gym, washing the dishes, or just relaxing. They‚Äôre a great way to learn something new, catch up on news, or be entertained.\r\n\r\nI get dozens of emails each week asking me how I produce the GaryVee Audio Experience, my Alexa Skills, and my newest addition #podSessions which is a new show made directly for my audio experience. I thought I would have my audio engineer Seth give you his POV and the knowledge he has gained since producing my podcast firsthand. There‚Äôs no one better to explain how to start a podcast than him so I hope you enjoy üòâ\r\n\r\nHi ‚Äì I‚Äôm Seth!\r\n\r\nI produce Gary‚Äôs podcast The GaryVee Audio Experience, as well as his Alexa skill, GaryVee 365, and other projects within the VaynerX world. I‚Äôve been playing with audio since high school, majored in it in college at SUNY Purchase, but really learned everything through trial and error. If you‚Äôre just here looking for the list of gear I use, it can be found HERE. To get you thinking about how you can scale your content, here‚Äôs how we approach the podcasts.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A PODCAST?\r\nA podcast is inherently a piece of digital audio content that‚Äôs available for digital download or streaming consumption.\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU NEED TO START A PODCAST\r\nWhen it comes down to it, the only things you REALLY need to start a podcast are a cell phone or computer, an internet connection, and something to talk about üôÇ\r\n\r\nThe General Workflow:\r\n\r\nIdeate, Record, Edit, Upload.\r\n\r\n1. STARTING A PODCAST: IDEA & OUTLINE\r\nOne you have a topic in mind, before you jump in & start to record, take some time and think about how you want your show to flow. Is it segmented? Is it just you, or you and a friend? Do you have guests? Remote interviews? Is it more like a talk show? You should start to think about a cadence, so your listeners know when to expect the next episode ‚Äì weekly? Monthly?  Once you‚Äôve nailed this down, move on.\r\n\r\n2. STARTING A PODCAST: THE BASICS\r\nYOUR CELLPHONE üì≤üì≤üì≤\r\n\r\nThe absolute easiest way to start a podcast if you have a smartphone, is an app called Anchor. Anchor is a relatively new app, that lets you create a podcast with just a few clicks, but it‚Äôs also more than just a podcasting app. Right now they‚Äôre trying to revamp the audio space, providing the space for you to have your own talk show, utilizing short form audio, long form audio, music, and more. You can interview your friends directly in-app, and even publish to iTunes. Create an account with Anchor, start recording, and then follow their instructions to distribute your podcast across their & other platforms.\r\n\r\n3. THE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED TO START A PODCAST\r\nGEAR: üéôüéßüñ•\r\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, you really only need your cell phone to record, but higher quality audio is always much, much nicer to listen to, so I‚Äôd recommend getting some audio equipment if you are thinking about becoming serious. This kit is a great example of a starter kit, and it‚Äôll allow you to record with up to two microphones at a time. You‚Äôll record directly to your computer from the Focusrite interface, using the two Audio Technica mics.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to the Focusrite interface would be this Zoom H4n, which records to an SD card, instead of a computer. You‚Äôll plug the mics directly into it, and then put the SD card into your computer to get the raw files off after recording.\r\n\r\n4. RECORDING & EDITING A PODCAST\r\nAudacity is my favorite free audio recording & editing software, but you can also use GarageBand if you have an Apple computer, or Adobe Audition if you‚Äôre rolling with Creative Cloud. Recording & editing is extremely similar across all three of these platforms but I‚Äôll focus on Audacity mainly, since it works on Mac or PC. Plug your audio interface to your computer. Plug the mics into the interface, and set up Audacity to record from them. Then, hit record and start talking! This guide has a good tutorial of things to watch out for in Audacity when recording, and how to fix things like plosives and other odd noises. Once you‚Äôre done recording, you can start to edit. When editing, focus on cutting up any awkward silences (unless you‚Äôre into that) and anything you don‚Äôt want in your final cut. Then, export the file. If you‚Äôre using Audacity, you‚Äôll need to read this to export as an MP3.\r\n\r\n5. HOW TO DISTRIBUTE A PODCAST\r\nBefore you publish your podcast, it‚Äôs a good idea to have 3-5 episodes ready to publish at once, especially for iTunes, to get your listeners hooked. It also gives you a little bit of lead time to create new content.\r\n\r\nOnce you‚Äôre ready to publish your podcast, you‚Äôll want to upload it for everyone to hear. The two main components here are the distribution / hosting service and podcatchers. The distribution / hosting service hosts your files for anyone to download, and generates an RSS feed that ‚Äúpodcatchers‚Äù (like iTunes) read to know where to download the file from & information about the podcast. Each distribution platform will essentially do similar things, but you should read up on each to decide what fits your needs best.\r\n\r\nThe Best Distribution & Hosting Services for Podcasts:\r\n\r\nAnchor ‚Äì The all in one solution for creating and distributing a podcast\r\n\r\nLibsyn ‚Äì This is what we use for Gary‚Äôs podcast\r\n\r\nShoutengine ‚Äì Awesome for just starting out\r\n\r\nPippa.io ‚Äì A new startup focusing on an easy entry into the podcasting space\r\n\r\nSimplecast ‚Äì Another low-cost alternative that‚Äôs worth a look\r\n\r\nA lot of podcatchers like Overcast will automatically begin to show your podcast once iTunes has accepted it, but here are a few podcatchers that you‚Äôll need to manually sign up and submit your RSS feed for:\r\n\r\niTunes ‚Äì This should be your first move. It‚Äôs a little more in-depth, but definitely the most popular.\r\n\r\nSoundcloud\r\n\r\nStitcher\r\n\r\nTuneIn\r\n\r\nSpotify (This process is a little different although Anchor and Libsyn currently support it)\r\n\r\nGoogle Play\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE GARYVEE AUDIO EXPERIENCE?\r\nThe GaryVee Audio Experience is GaryVee‚Äôs podcast. It‚Äôs unique in that there‚Äôs new content published every single day. The type of content ranges from original to repurposed programming, as follows:\r\n\r\n#podSessions: A brand new format, where Gary & 3 guests chop it up about culturally relevant topics. This is the most podcast-native content we produce.\r\n\r\n#AskGaryVee: A Q&A show where Gary takes questions from his fans and answers them. It‚Äôs a staple piece of content in Gary‚Äôs arsenal and for the podcast, we share the greatest answers and episodes from the show.\r\n\r\nDailyVee: I‚Äôll occasionally post an episode from my vlog DailyVee, or a specific clip or rant from an episode as ‚Äúraw‚Äù content if it‚Äôs powerful enough for audio.\r\n\r\nKeynotes: Long-form content seems to really take hold for podcasts so keynotes from Gary fit in pretty perfectly and since no two are the same, it makes for some really great material.\r\n\r\nInterviews & Business meetings: A behind the scenes look into what it‚Äôs like to have business meetings, ideate on ideas, or be interviewed.  Discussions can feature influential people & artists in popular culture, ranging from music, to business, to sports and more.\r\n\r\nRants: We love featuring rants about topics that Gary feels strongly about. They‚Äôre short and sweet and they need to be heard üôÇ\r\n\r\nMashups: This is another form of original content. I edit a mashup around a topic that Gary speaks about often (i.e. empathy, gratitude, Instagram marketing, tips for what to do after college, etc.) and put a piece together highlighting some of his better clips.\r\n\r\nPrior to posting daily, Gary‚Äôs podcast was a collection of randomly posted keynotes & #askgaryvee episodes that were being published without any set or expected cadence. The decision to post every single day grew the podcast to become a consistent TOP 100 overall podcast in iTunes, and a constant top 10 in iTunes business, growing from an average of 100,000 downloads a month to around 5 Million downloads a month.\r\n\r\nHOW TO PROMOTE A PODCAST\r\nNow, obviously, in order to be heard, you‚Äôll need to get the word out about your new podcast. Just because the content is in audio-form doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get creative about how you promote the show. You should be promoting it across every social channel possible by utilizing all the digital tools you have at your disposal.\r\n\r\nHOW TO PROMOTE A PODCAST ON YOUR BLOG\r\nPodcasts are still one of the most important white spaces to build your business or brand. The cost of starting one is practically zero (granted, you have a smartphone and access to WiFi) and you can easily get the ball rolling with just the bare basics. Gary had me write this article to give you the blueprint on how it‚Äôs not only possible but practical to start a podcast of your own. I hope you enjoyed and I can‚Äôt wait to see what you create.', 'img2.png', '2018-07-22 12:24:26'),

(7, 'Shareholders: What Are They and How It Can Affect Your Investments', 'Companies aren‚Äôt just whole entities. They‚Äôre made up of tiny parts called shares. Each share represents a certain percentage of the company, and shareholders own those shares.\r\nWhen you invest in the stock market, you buy shares ‚Äî essentially pieces of paper that entitle you to a portion of the company‚Äôs profits if it makes money. Whether you make or lose money depends on the stock price.\r\nFor instance, if a company‚Äôs stock is trading at $14 per share and you buy 1,000 shares, you‚Äôve invested $14,000 in the company. Should the stock shoot up to $18, you‚Äôll make money. If it sinks to $12, you lose money.\r\nInvestors buy shares of stocks because they want to turn a profit. If they‚Äôre like me, they might invest in small companies for hours or even minutes. Others hold on to more expensive stock for months or years.\r\nRegardless, everyone who invests in the stock market trades shares.

(14, 'Shareholders: What Are They and How It Can Affect Your Investments', 'Companies aren‚Äôt just whole entities. They‚Äôre made up of tiny parts called shares. Each share represents a certain percentage of the company, and shareholders own those shares.\r\nWhen you invest in the stock market, you buy shares ‚Äî essentially pieces of paper that entitle you to a portion of the company‚Äôs profits if it makes money. Whether you make or lose money depends on the stock price.\r\nFor instance, if a company‚Äôs stock is trading at $14 per share and you buy 1,000 shares, you‚Äôve invested $14,000 in the company. Should the stock shoot up to $18, you‚Äôll make money. If it sinks to $12, you lose money.\r\nInvestors buy shares of stocks because they want to turn a profit. If they‚Äôre like me, they might invest in small companies for hours or even minutes. Others hold on to more expensive stock for months or years.\r\nRegardless, everyone who invests in the stock market trades shares.

(15, 'How to start a podcast', 'Every influencer and individual interested in producing content, building a brand, starting or growing a business, selling a product, service, or idea should learn how to start a podcast on iTunes, Soundcloud, Spotify, Sticher, iHeart Radio, Google Play, and any other platform offering the real estate. It‚Äôs a massively important space that I constantly get asked about so I decided it was time to put this article out.\r\n\r\nI have been preaching the power of podcasts and voice technology for the last 18-24 months. Podcasts and audio-first consumption are clearly exploding, and they‚Äôre one of the best ways to get started creating content for your business, product, service or brand. I recently wrote an article on ‚ÄúThe Rise of Audio and Voice‚Äù that you can read to understand my $.02\r\n\r\nAs multitasking culture continues to grow, podcasts take on a more important role in our everyday life. We all care about our time and if there‚Äôs a way to save some, we‚Äôll do it. Just like music or audiobooks, podcasts can be consumed while doing laundry, going to the gym, washing the dishes, or just relaxing. They‚Äôre a great way to learn something new, catch up on news, or be entertained.\r\n\r\nI get dozens of emails each week asking me how I produce the GaryVee Audio Experience, my Alexa Skills, and my newest addition #podSessions which is a new show made directly for my audio experience. I thought I would have my audio engineer Seth give you his POV and the knowledge he has gained since producing my podcast firsthand. There‚Äôs no one better to explain how to start a podcast than him so I hope you enjoy üòâ\r\n\r\nHi ‚Äì I‚Äôm Seth!\r\n\r\nI produce Gary‚Äôs podcast The GaryVee Audio Experience, as well as his Alexa skill, GaryVee 365, and other projects within the VaynerX world. I‚Äôve been playing with audio since high school, majored in it in college at SUNY Purchase, but really learned everything through trial and error. If you‚Äôre just here looking for the list of gear I use, it can be found HERE. To get you thinking about how you can scale your content, here‚Äôs how we approach the podcasts.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A PODCAST?\r\nA podcast is inherently a piece of digital audio content that‚Äôs available for digital download or streaming consumption.\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU NEED TO START A PODCAST\r\nWhen it comes down to it, the only things you REALLY need to start a podcast are a cell phone or computer, an internet connection, and something to talk about üôÇ\r\n\r\nThe General Workflow:\r\n\r\nIdeate, Record, Edit, Upload.\r\n\r\n1. STARTING A PODCAST: IDEA & OUTLINE\r\nOne you have a topic in mind, before you jump in & start to record, take some time and think about how you want your show to flow. Is it segmented? Is it just you, or you and a friend? Do you have guests? Remote interviews? Is it more like a talk show? You should start to think about a cadence, so your listeners know when to expect the next episode ‚Äì weekly? Monthly?  Once you‚Äôve nailed this down, move on.\r\n\r\n2. STARTING A PODCAST: THE BASICS\r\nYOUR CELLPHONE üì≤üì≤üì≤\r\n\r\nThe absolute easiest way to start a podcast if you have a smartphone, is an app called Anchor. Anchor is a relatively new app, that lets you create a podcast with just a few clicks, but it‚Äôs also more than just a podcasting app. Right now they‚Äôre trying to revamp the audio space, providing the space for you to have your own talk show, utilizing short form audio, long form audio, music, and more. You can interview your friends directly in-app, and even publish to iTunes. Create an account with Anchor, start recording, and then follow their instructions to distribute your podcast across their & other platforms.\r\n\r\n3. THE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED TO START A PODCAST\r\nGEAR: üéôüéßüñ•\r\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, you really only need your cell phone to record, but higher quality audio is always much, much nicer to listen to, so I‚Äôd recommend getting some audio equipment if you are thinking about becoming serious. This kit is a great example of a starter kit, and it‚Äôll allow you to record with up to two microphones at a time. You‚Äôll record directly to your computer from the Focusrite interface, using the two Audio Technica mics.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to the Focusrite interface would be this Zoom H4n, which records to an SD card, instead of a computer. You‚Äôll plug the mics directly into it, and then put the SD card into your computer to get the raw files off after recording.\r\n\r\n4. RECORDING & EDITING A PODCAST\r\nAudacity is my favorite free audio recording & editing software, but you can also use GarageBand if you have an Apple computer, or Adobe Audition if you‚Äôre rolling with Creative Cloud. Recording & editing is extremely similar across all three of these platforms but I‚Äôll focus on Audacity mainly, since it works on Mac or PC. Plug your audio interface to your computer. Plug the mics into the interface, and set up Audacity to record from them. Then, hit record and start talking! This guide has a good tutorial of things to watch out for in Audacity when recording, and how to fix things like plosives and other odd noises. Once you‚Äôre done recording, you can start to edit. When editing, focus on cutting up any awkward silences (unless you‚Äôre into that) and anything you don‚Äôt want in your final cut. Then, export the file. If you‚Äôre using Audacity, you‚Äôll need to read this to export as an MP3.\r\n\r\n5. HOW TO DISTRIBUTE A PODCAST\r\nBefore you publish your podcast, it‚Äôs a good idea to have 3-5 episodes ready to publish at once, especially for iTunes, to get your listeners hooked. It also gives you a little bit of lead time to create new content.\r\n\r\nOnce you‚Äôre ready to publish your podcast, you‚Äôll want to upload it for everyone to hear. The two main components here are the distribution / hosting service and podcatchers. The distribution / hosting service hosts your files for anyone to download, and generates an RSS feed that ‚Äúpodcatchers‚Äù (like iTunes) read to know where to download the file from & information about the podcast. Each distribution platform will essentially do similar things, but you should read up on each to decide what fits your needs best.\r\n\r\nThe Best Distribution & Hosting Services for Podcasts:\r\n\r\nAnchor ‚Äì The all in one solution for creating and distributing a podcast\r\n\r\nLibsyn ‚Äì This is what we use for Gary‚Äôs podcast\r\n\r\nShoutengine ‚Äì Awesome for just starting out\r\n\r\nPippa.io ‚Äì A new startup focusing on an easy entry into the podcasting space\r\n\r\nSimplecast ‚Äì Another low-cost alternative that‚Äôs worth a look\r\n\r\nA lot of podcatchers like Overcast will automatically begin to show your podcast once iTunes has accepted it, but here are a few podcatchers that you‚Äôll need to manually sign up and submit your RSS feed for:\r\n\r\niTunes ‚Äì This should be your first move. It‚Äôs a little more in-depth, but definitely the most popular.\r\n\r\nSoundcloud\r\n\r\nStitcher\r\n\r\nTuneIn\r\n\r\nSpotify (This process is a little different although Anchor and Libsyn currently support it)\r\n\r\nGoogle Play\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE GARYVEE AUDIO EXPERIENCE?\r\nThe GaryVee Audio Experience is GaryVee‚Äôs podcast. It‚Äôs unique in that there‚Äôs new content published every single day. The type of content ranges from original to repurposed programming, as follows:\r\n\r\n#podSessions: A brand new format, where Gary & 3 guests chop it up about culturally relevant topics. This is the most podcast-native content we produce.\r\n\r\n#AskGaryVee: A Q&A show where Gary takes questions from his fans and answers them. It‚Äôs a staple piece of content in Gary‚Äôs arsenal and for the podcast, we share the greatest answers and episodes from the show.\r\n\r\nDailyVee: I‚Äôll occasionally post an episode from my vlog DailyVee, or a specific clip or rant from an episode as ‚Äúraw‚Äù content if it‚Äôs powerful enough for audio.\r\n\r\nKeynotes: Long-form content seems to really take hold for podcasts so keynotes from Gary fit in pretty perfectly and since no two are the same, it makes for some really great material.\r\n\r\nInterviews & Business meetings: A behind the scenes look into what it‚Äôs like to have business meetings, ideate on ideas, or be interviewed.  Discussions can feature influential people & artists in popular culture, ranging from music, to business, to sports and more.\r\n\r\nRants: We love featuring rants about topics that Gary feels strongly about. They‚Äôre short and sweet and they need to be heard üôÇ\r\n\r\nMashups: This is another form of original content. I edit a mashup around a topic that Gary speaks about often (i.e. empathy, gratitude, Instagram marketing, tips for what to do after college, etc.) and put a piece together highlighting some of his better clips.\r\n\r\nPrior to posting daily, Gary‚Äôs podcast was a collection of randomly posted keynotes & #askgaryvee episodes that were being published without any set or expected cadence. The decision to post every single day grew the podcast to become a consistent TOP 100 overall podcast in iTunes, and a constant top 10 in iTunes business, growing from an average of 100,000 downloads a month to around 5 Million downloads a month.\r\n\r\nHOW TO PROMOTE A PODCAST\r\nNow, obviously, in order to be heard, you‚Äôll need to get the word out about your new podcast. Just because the content is in audio-form doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get creative about how you promote the show. You should be promoting it across every social channel possible by utilizing all the digital tools you have at your disposal.\r\n\r\nHOW TO PROMOTE A PODCAST ON YOUR BLOG\r\nPodcasts are still one of the most important white spaces to build your business or brand. The cost of starting one is practically zero (granted, you have a smartphone and access to WiFi) and you can easily get the ball rolling with just the bare basics. Gary had me write this article to give you the blueprint on how it‚Äôs not only possible but practical to start a podcast of your own.
